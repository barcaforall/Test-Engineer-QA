  <p>
    Email: barcaforall@gmail.com<br>
    Passcode: Skypro123<br>
  </p>
  <h2>Goals:</h2>
<p>
  Test new element of the teacher's calendar - personal events:<br>
  - Adding personal event<br>
  - Editing personal event<br>
  - Compatibility of personal event and a lesson<br>
  - deleting personal event<br>
  - API
</p>
<h2>Types of Tests Were Used:</h2>
<p>
  - Requirement Testing<br>
  - Smoke testing <br>
  - Manual Functional Testing Using Checklists<br>
  - Testing API<br>
  - Acceptance Testing
</p>
<h2>Test Results:</h2>
<p>
  After testing and launching the collection, a backend error was identified. The error: if a created new event is edited only in the date field, then this edited event is not deleted. A total of 18 test cases were run and five of the 18 test cases had an edited event date, which resulted in a deletion error. In these five test cases, the edited events were not deleted.
</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
Based on the work done, I still want to conclude that the site is ready for release, because this error is detected only on the API and is not reproduced on the UI.

</p>
<h2>Problems:</h2>
<p>
  The encryption was broken, unfortunately.<br>

The development team removed half of the data during refactoring.<br>
The remaining half was almost completely erased by business analysts while they were figuring out the requirements.<br>
The testers received this option:<br>
